Simon Game is a game for children and adults. It was intended as a tool to improve memory and to have fun.
The original game was a physical game, a console game. 
"Simon is an electronic game of short-term memory skill invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison, working for toy design firm Marvin Glass and Associates,[1] with software programming by Lenny Cope. The device creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence. If the user succeeds, the series becomes progressively longer and more complex ...

In this version, if the player reaches a certain number of rounds, he/she wins and the game ends.
